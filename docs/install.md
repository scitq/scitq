# Install

## Prerequisites
There are three build requirements:
- Go : see [Go installation](https://go.dev/doc/install):
    - [download](https://go.dev/dl/) the archive, 
    - untar it with `rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.25.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz`,
    - add the path if needed with `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`
- Node.js : not needed for production but needed to compile the Svelte UI, see [Node download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Make : this should be available in your favorite distribution: `apt install make`
- Git : to download and manage the code: `apt install git`

What follows is required for production but not for build.
- PostgreSQL : this should be available in your favorite distribution: `apt install postgresql`
- Python 3.8+ : this should be available in your favorite distribution: `apt install python3`
- Optional (but recommanded) : Docker : `apt install docker.io`

## Installation

- Download the code: `git clone https://github.com/scitq/scitq`
- Compile and install: `cd scitq && sudo make install`

## What you get

Build will give you three binaries installed in `/usr/local/bin/`:
- `scitq-server` : the server binary, including the go engine, the Svelte UI and the python DSL, see below for configuration details,
- `scitq-client` : the client binary, e.g. what runs on a worker, usually deployed automatically, but you can install it manually also, see below,
- `scitq` : the CLI binary, ready to use, see usage.

## Configuration

scitq uses a single YAML configuration file, typically `/etc/scitq.yaml`.

A complete example is provided here:

ðŸ“„ [sample_files/scitq.yaml](https://github.com/scitq/scitq/blob/main/sample_files/scitq.yaml)

You can copy and adapt it for your environment.

Please find a detailed explanation about config items:

## Setup the service

You'll need to setup the database like this:

```sh
# Create the database
sudo -u postgres createdb scitq

# Create a user and set a password (youâ€™ll be prompted)
sudo -u postgres createuser -P scitq_user

# Make the new user the owner of the new DB
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER DATABASE scitq OWNER TO scitq_user;"
```

Then create and activate the service by:

```sh
# Create the service
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scitq/scitq/main/sample_files/scitq.service \
  -o /etc/systemd/system/scitq.service

# Reload systemd configuration
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable and start the service
sudo systemctl enable --now scitq.service
```
