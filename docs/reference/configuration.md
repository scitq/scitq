|  | OfflineTimeout | `scitq.offline_timeout` | `30` | `int` | OfflineTimeout is the timeout in seconds after which offline workers are considered lost. |
|  | TaskDownloadTimeout | `scitq.task_download_timeout` | `600` | `int` | TaskDownloadTimeout is the timeout in seconds for task data downloads. |
|  | TaskExecutionTimeout | `scitq.task_execution_timeout` | `0` | `int` | TaskExecutionTimeout is the timeout in seconds for task execution. A value of 0 disables the timeout. |
|  | TaskUploadTimeout | `scitq.task_upload_timeout` | `600` | `int` | TaskUploadTimeout is the timeout in seconds for uploading task results. |
|  | ConsideredLostTimeout | `scitq.considered_lost_timeout` | `300` | `int` | ConsideredLostTimeout is the timeout in seconds after which a task is considered lost. |
|  | AdminUser | `scitq.admin_user` | `admin` | `string` | AdminUser is the username for the administrator account. |
|  | AdminHashedPassword | `scitq.admin_hashed_password` | `` | `string` | AdminHashedPassword is the hashed password for the administrator account. It can be generated by CLI : `scitq hashpassword MySuperPassword` |
